Women Safety with Location Tracking & Emergency Alert System
This project is aimed at helping women during unsafe situations.
The system allows a user to send an SOS alert along with their live location to registered emergency contacts.
The app can also send the alert to the nearest police station based on the user’s GPS location.
A simple backend/server will receive the alert and show the user’s live movement on a dashboard.
This project is currently in the initial development stage, working on basic flow and architecture.
